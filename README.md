# Hey, Teacher!

This might be confusing, but Xcode decided to push everything, so, just to say that all the code is under "KitsuRoad-Source-iOS", and in case you want/need to compile and run it, it was made under Xcode 16.2

## Prototype Plan

The prototype plan for this very own project, is to polish it to the point it is usable for end-users, some of the things to add are:

 1. Sync with a Database.
    1. Get the "server" ready. âœ…
    2. Setup Databases in MariaDB.
    3. Setup each Marker variable in the database.
    4. Setup connections with the Swift code.
 2. Make it so you can select where to put the pin (For now, as in testing it is random in a radius.
      1. Setup the accidents icons.
      2. Make it that instead of opening the open in your face it moves to the map tab.
 4. Make it so it retrieves traffic data when there's an "accident" present. (When there's an accident present, make it so it appears how much traffic there is.)

As for energy consumption, it could vary from 10W to 20W as the "server" is just an old MacBook 5,2 (Mid-2009) with no battery with a 60W charger. And from energy transformation, it transforms energy to heat as the processor get hot.

**There's no way to define physical characteristics of this project, as it is something that is totally made digitally, which that's why we can't tell stuff like Distances, Displacement, Velocity and Application of Force.**
